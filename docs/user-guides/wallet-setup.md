# 🔐 Wallet Setup Guide

Learn how to set up and connect a TON wallet to use WajoB securely.

## Why Do I Need a Wallet?

Your TON wallet is like your digital bank account for cryptocurrency. You need it to:

- 💰 **Send and receive payments** on WajoB
- 🔒 **Secure your funds** with blockchain technology
- ✅ **Verify your identity** through wallet signatures
- 💼 **Interact with smart contracts** (escrow)

> 🔐 **Important**: Only YOU control your wallet. WajoB never has access to your funds!

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Protecting Your Seed Phrase

✅ **DO:**
- Write on paper and store in safe/lockbox
- Make 2-3 copies in different secure locations
- Use metal seed phrase storage (fireproof)
- Consider splitting storage across locations
- Test recovery process with small amount first

🚫 **DON'T:**
- Take screenshots or photos
- Store in cloud (Google Drive, iCloud, etc.)
- Email or text to yourself
- Share with anyone (even support staff)
- Store in password managers (controversial, but risky)

### Wallet App Security

✅ **Enable:**
- Biometric authentication (Face ID, fingerprint)
- PIN code protection
- Auto-lock after 1 minute
- Transaction confirmation prompts

✅ **Regular habits:**
- Keep app updated to latest version
- Review connected apps monthly
- Check transaction history weekly
- Monitor wallet balance

### Transaction Safety

Before approving any transaction:

1. ✅ **Verify amount** - Correct TON amount?
2. ✅ **Check recipient** - Correct address?
3. ✅ **Review gas fee** - Reasonable (0.01-0.05 TON)?
4. ✅ **Confirm action** - What does this transaction do?

> ⚠️ **Red flags:**
> - 🚨 Unexpected transaction requests
> - 🚨 Very high gas fees (>0.5 TON)
> - 🚨 Unknown recipient addresses
> - 🚨 Urgent pressure to approve

### Scam Prevention

🚫 **Common scams to avoid:**

1. **Fake Support**
   - WajoB will NEVER ask for your seed phrase
   - Support never sends DMs first
   - No "wallet verification" required

2. **Phishing Websites**
   - Always check URL: `wagob.io`
   - Look for HTTPS and lock icon
   - Bookmark official site

3. **Too Good to Be True Jobs**
   - Suspiciously high wages
   - No work required
   - Upfront payment requests

4. **Impersonation**
   - Fake @WajoBBot accounts
   - Clone websites
   - Fake Telegram groups
