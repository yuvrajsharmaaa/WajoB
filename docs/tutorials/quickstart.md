## 🎓 Understanding Key Concepts

### What is Escrow?

Think of escrow as a "money lock box":

```
1. Employer locks payment in escrow
        ↓
2. Worker sees payment is secured
        ↓
3. Worker completes job with confidence
        ↓
4. Employer confirms completion
        ↓
5. Payment automatically releases to worker
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Worker guaranteed payment if job done
- ✅ Employer protected from scams
- ✅ No one can steal the funds
- ✅ Blockchain-secured trust

### How Reputation Works

Build trust through verified ratings:

- **Get rated** after each job (1-5 stars)
- **Score displayed** on your profile
- **Higher score** = more opportunities
- **Recent ratings** weighted more

**Example:**
```
Worker "Sarah" Profile:
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4.8 (23 jobs)
↑ Trending up

Recent ratings:
5⭐ - "Super fast and professional!"
5⭐ - "Delivered exactly on time"
4⭐ - "Good work, minor delay"
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Employers:

✅ **DO:**
- Write clear, detailed descriptions
- Set realistic deadlines
- Check worker ratings before accepting
- Release payment promptly after completion
- Leave honest ratings

❌ **DON'T:**

- Leave negative ratings without reason

### For Workers:

✅ **DO:**
- Apply only to jobs you can complete
- Communicate clearly with employer
- Deliver on time and as described
- Ask questions before starting
- Build your reputation consistently

❌ **DON'T:**
