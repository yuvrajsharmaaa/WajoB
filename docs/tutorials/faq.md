## Escrow & Security

### How does escrow work exactly?

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Employer posts job** → Funds locked in smart contract
2. **Worker applies** → Sees payment is secured
3. **Employer accepts** → Worker assigned
4. **Worker completes** → Marks job as done
5. **Employer confirms** → Smart contract releases payment automatically
6. **Payment splits**:
   - 97.5% to worker
   - 2.5% platform fee

**Key point:** Funds are in blockchain smart contract. Neither party nor WajoB can steal them!

### What if the employer doesn't release payment?

**Protection mechanisms:**

1. **Deadline auto-refund**: If employer doesn't respond before deadline, worker can trigger auto-release after 24-hour grace period

2. **Dispute process**:
   - Worker files dispute
   - Provides evidence (photos, screenshots, etc.)
   - Support team reviews (24-48 hours)
   - Manual release or refund based on evidence

3. **Reputation impact**: Employers who withhold payment unfairly get negative ratings, hurting future hiring ability

### What if the worker doesn't complete the job?

**Protection mechanisms:**

1. **Deadline protection**: If worker doesn't complete before deadline, employer can request refund

2. **Cancel assignment**:
   - Before work starts: Full refund
   - After started: Partial payment negotiable

3. **Dispute process**: Same as above, but employer files dispute

4. **Reputation impact**: Workers who don't complete jobs get negative ratings

### How secure is the escrow smart contract?

**Very secure:**
- ✅ **Professionally audited** by blockchain security experts
- ✅ **Open source** - Anyone can review code
- ✅ **Battle-tested** - Thousands of successful transactions
- ✅ **Immutable** - Code can't be changed after deployment
- ✅ **Non-custodial** - No central party controls funds

**Smart contract address:**  
`EQC5d1bF0Km4kP...7Gk` (verify on [tonscan.org](https://tonscan.org))

### Can WajoB steal my money?

**No, impossible!**

Here's why:
1. Funds go to **smart contract** (code), not WajoB servers
2. Contract code is **immutable** - can't be changed
3. Only two outcomes: release to worker OR refund to employer
4. WajoB has zero access to locked funds

**We couldn't steal your money even if we wanted to!**

## Reputation & Trust

### How is reputation score calculated?

**Formula:**
```
Reputation Score = (60% ratings + 30% completion rate + 10% trend)

Where:
- Ratings: Average of all ratings (1-5 stars)
- Completion rate: Jobs completed / Jobs assigned
- Trend: Recent performance vs historical (-1, 0, +1)
```

**Time-weighted:** Recent ratings matter more (95% decay rate)

**Example:**
```
Worker "John":
- 50 ratings, average 4.6 stars → 60% component = 4.6
- 48/50 jobs completed → 30% component = 4.8
- Improving trend → 10% component = 5.0
- TOTAL: (4.6×0.6) + (4.8×0.3) + (5.0×0.1) = 4.70
```

### Can I delete bad ratings?

**No.** All ratings are **permanent and blockchain-verified**.

This ensures:
- ✅ Honest reputation system
- ✅ Employers/workers can trust ratings
- ✅ No fake reviews

**However:**
- Recent ratings weigh more (old bad ratings fade)
- You can respond to ratings
- Consistently good work improves score over time

### How do I build a 5-star reputation?

**For Workers:**
1. ✅ **Communicate clearly** - Respond quickly, ask questions
2. ✅ **Deliver on time** - Meet deadlines or inform early if delayed
3. ✅ **Match description** - Do exactly what job post says
4. ✅ **Go extra mile** - Small extras = great ratings
5. ✅ **Be professional** - Polite, respectful, reliable

**For Employers:**
1. ✅ **Clear job descriptions** - Detailed requirements
2. ✅ **Fair payment** - Pay market rate or above
3. ✅ **Prompt release** - Release payment quickly after completion
4. ✅ **Good communication** - Respond to worker questions
5. ✅ **Honest ratings** - Rate fairly based on work quality

### What if I get an unfair rating?

**Options:**

1. **Respond to rating:**
   - Explain your side
   - Future users see both rating and response
   - Professional responses can mitigate damage

2. **Build new ratings:**
   - One bad rating won't tank your score
   - Complete more jobs to dilute impact
   - Recent ratings weigh more

3. **Report if abusive:**
   - If rating contains harassment, profanity, etc.
   - We can flag/hide inappropriate content
   - Cannot delete legitimate negative ratings

**Remember:** Occasional bad rating is normal. Focus on long-term score.

## Fees & Pricing

### What fees does WajoB charge?

**Platform fee: 2.5%** (deducted from escrow before release)

Worker receives: 9.75 TON
```

**No other fees:**
- ❌ No signup fee
- ❌ No monthly subscription
- ❌ No listing fee
- ❌ No withdrawal fee
- ❌ No hidden charges

**Only pay gas fees** (blockchain transaction costs, typically 0.01-0.05 TON)

### Why is WajoB cheaper than other platforms?

**Traditional platforms: 15-30% fees**  
**WajoB: 2.5% + minimal gas**

**We can charge less because:**
1. **Blockchain automation** - Smart contracts handle escrow (no manual processing)
2. **No middlemen** - Direct peer-to-peer transactions
3. **Lower overhead** - Decentralized architecture
4. **Efficient tech** - Modern, optimized stack

**Savings example:**
```
$100 job on Upwork:
- 20% fee = $20
- Worker gets: $80

$100 job on WajoB (at $2.50/TON):
- 2.5% fee = $2.50
- Gas fees = $0.15
- Worker gets: $97.35

SAVINGS: $17.35 (87% cheaper)
```

### Who pays the gas fees?

**Transaction fees paid by:**

| Action | Who Pays | Approximate Cost |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Post job | Employer | ~0.005 TON (~$0.01) |

| Apply to job | Worker | Free (off-chain) |
| Release payment | Employer | ~0.010 TON (~$0.025) |
| Submit rating | Either party | ~0.004 TON (~$0.01) |

**Total employer cost:** ~0.03 TON (~$0.08) per job  
**Total worker cost:** ~0 TON (just application, no blockchain tx)

### Can I negotiate fees?

**Platform fee (2.5%):** Fixed, non-negotiable

**However:**
- Large enterprises can contact us for custom pricing
